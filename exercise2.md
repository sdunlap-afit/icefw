3. What are some parts of memory that could be useful? Where would we find references to these peices?  
   <details closed>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <br>
   <b>Communication</b>, Bootloader, Memory Writes, Memory References
   </details>
4. Now it's time for the most important part <b>Documentation!!</b>
5. Open the STM32_Doc.pdf. What would we be looking for? We discussed it just a second ago.
   <details closed>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <br>
   Memory Map!
   </details>
6. Crtl+F and look for the Memory Map for our chip. What sections should we add?
   <details closed>
   <summary>Answer</summary>
   <br>
   USART's(Specifically USART2), CAN
   </details>
   
7. Fill in the details and click add for each section you would like to add to the Memory Map. If you had a file you wanted to add you would select File Bytes at the bottom and navigate to the file you would like to include in that space in memory(Useful to add bootloader or other sections of code). <br>

### Instructions
1. Find the first line of code in the file. Where is it? Does it look like the program starts here?
	<details closed>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<br>
	Click on navigate if you haven't found it and enter the address of the first line of code.

2. What are some issues an unclear start position can cause? How can this make it difficult to Reverse Engineer?
	<details closed>
	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<br>
	An unclear start position means the Ghidra can have trouble decompiling the code and walking through it. It also means that we can have issues following the control flow of the code.
	</details>
3. So what should we check if we can't follow the code from the start? What are some integral parts of the code that we can trace back to an area that allows us to insert our own jump command?
	<details closed>
	<summary>Hints</summary>
	<br>
	USART2(Check the location we added to memory map), Bootloader Jump to Firmware, **Command Code Resolution**, etc..
	</details>

4. What have you been able to find? Is there any room for a jump code insertion? What makes a good place for inserting our Jump code?
	<details closed>
	<summary>Hints</summary>
	<br>
	Look for places that we can choose ourselves whether it get's called. Possibly where we could insert custom commands.
	</details>

5. Go to the search menu at the top of Ghidra and select search for scalars from the resulting menu. Select "specific scalar" and then begin entering some of the command codes in hex. Which codes are more unique for hex? Try several of them if the first doesn't work out. What kind of code layout would be optimal for selecting the flow for differing command codes?

	</details>

6. Which variable does it use to jump? How does it resolve the code to the jump instruction? Take a look at the jump table and what values it holds and the location of the resulting jump. You'll have to do some math.

	<summary>Answer</summary>
	<br>
	From observing the index and parameter along with the resulting jump location we know that the index is found by [Command Code]-1 and the jump location is decide by ([Goal Address] â€“ 0x08034a40)/2.
	</details>

7. Where does the 0x02B2h take you? The default case for the switch statement. This looks like a great place to insert our own command statement. Where should we make it jump to? The jump options are too short for the jump table to make it to the end of the file. Maybe there is another option?
	<details closed>
	<summary>Hints</summary>
	<br>
	Redundant Error Statements are the perfect place to insert our Jump Code.
	<img width="1173" height="150" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c771ef50-a748-44ae-8c33-258a8da03b82" />
	</details>

8. First let's make our Jump Table jump to the last line of the redundant error statement whenever we send a command code of 09. Do the math! Right click on the correct index and click Patch Data and type the correct set of bytes to jump to the last line of our error statement (0x008034b04).  <br>

	</details>

9. Now we need to find where we want our Jump command to navigate to. Look for an unused section of memory/code or add code onto the end of the file.
 	<details closed>
	<summary>Hint</summary>
	<br>
	Go to 0x08039828
	</details>

10. Now that we have identified the the location we are going to add code to, go back and add a ```bl``` instruction to the last line of our Redundant Error statement that we jump to. Right click on the line and select path instruction. Then type ```bl``` in the left box and ```0x08039828``` in the right box.  <br>
<img width="576" height="516" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/507dbe00-9923-465c-b05e-6809c2c5b04e" />

11. Congratulation you have successfully patched in a jump to your own instructions! Now it's time to learn how to change the way the program functions.
12. Navigate to Case 40(The set speed command 0x08034978) and look for what register/variable is used to set the speed.
 	<details closed>
	<summary>Hint</summary>
	<br>
	r4 is used to store the Float value of the speed.
	</details>

13. Let's edit what value our code sets the speed to be a constant rather then a variable. Right click on a free line of memory, preferably further down to leave room for our commands, and right click, hover over data, and then click on the float variable. Then right click again and select patch data(like we did in the previous instructions) and then set the float value to a constant, like 10 for example.
<img width="655" height="667" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cec7b8c3-8c96-4742-a54c-3bff2db0606e" />

14. Now we want to add commands that set r4 to our intended value. Our assembler doesn't like to load 4 bytes of memory into one register in a single command so we are going to utilize the move high (```movt```) and the move low(```movw```) instructions to reference our constant. Ghidra helps you format your commands, can you figure it out?

15. Now that we have set the value of the register to our constant we can jump to the actual set speed instructions.

 16. What are we forgetting? The HEADER! We won't be able to upload the file without the header containing the file info! Now navigate to the File tab in the top left of Ghidra and select export program. Make sure the format is set to Original program in order to export it as a .cs.  <br>
	<img width="632" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c946f86d-5ed5-4409-a7d2-433996f34ccc" />

17. Make sure to store a copy of your .cs file by compressing it into a zip folder, we'll come back to this in a bit.
    <img width="267" height="186" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/81516235-85a1-4d16-8796-21a138006a83" />

    
19. Open up ImHEX(after following the prompts) and drag your control_program.cs and your control_program_copy.cs into the editor. On your exported control_program_copy.cs left click on the first byte and select insert. You are going to want to insert the size of the header (0x72).
    <img width="778" height="713" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16e6b8a7-84d8-43cb-86a3-cc923100fea6" />

20. Now move over to your control_program.cs and copy the first 0x72 bytes and then past them into your control_program_copy.cs. Make sure to save the file when you are done copying the header.  <br>
    <img width="560" height="542" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bea68643-b064-40a1-b131-31fd3bd472c8" />

21. Remember what bytes in the header are the CRC value? Navigate into the zip folder and right click on the file. Click on the properties menu and you should see the CRC value displayed on the bottom half.  <br>
    <img width="357" height="446" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4e31fb2-5c8d-4f5f-8e34-cc602ae73cbb" />
    
22. Replace the CRC bytes in the header with what is displayed on your properties menu. Remember that the program operates in little endian! Save the file when you are done. Don't worry your CRC value may different then mine depending on where we wrote the instructions and saved the float value.  <br>
