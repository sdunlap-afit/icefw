The 1756-L61 is a CPU module for the ControlLogix series of PLCs. It is used in a wide variety of industrial control systems. The firmware is stored in a flash chip and is updated over the network. I have provided three different versions of the firmware for the 1756-L61. These were simply downloaded from Rockwell's website. You will need to analyze them and answer the questions above.

* PN-49503.bin - version 16.56
* PN-49505.bin - version 16.80
* PN-69415.bin - version 18.11
